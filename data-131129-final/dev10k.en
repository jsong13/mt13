REPHRASED
Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses : Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice
We , the States Members of the United Nations ,
Having assembled at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005 , to decide to take more effective concerted action , in a spirit of cooperation , to combat crime and seek justice ,
Convinced that the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice , which constitute a major intergovernmental forum , have contributed to national policies and practices by facilitating the exchange of views and experience , mobilizing public opinion and recommending policy options at the national , regional and international levels , thus making a significant contribution to progress and the promotion of international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice ,
Recalling the work of the ten previous United Nations congresses ,
Reaffirming the responsibility vested in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme to work , together with Member States and regional and international organizations , in the fields of crime prevention and criminal justice ,
Greatly concerned by the expansion and dimensions of transnational organized crime , including illicit drug trafficking , money - laundering , trafficking in persons , smuggling of migrants , illegal arms trafficking and terrorism , and any existing links among them , and by the increasing sophistication and diversification of the activities of organized criminal groups ,
Emphasizing that enhancing dialogue among civilizations , promoting tolerance , preventing the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures and addressing development issues and unresolved conflicts will contribute to international cooperation , which is among the most important elements to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , and reaffirming that no terrorist act can be justified in any circumstance ,
Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all of their obligations under international law and that they should adopt such measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and international law , in particular international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law ,
Alarmed by the rapid growth , geographical extent and effects of new economic and financial crimes , which have emerged as significant threats to national economies and the international financial system ,
Highlighting the need for an integrated and systemic approach to combating corruption and money - laundering , within existing frameworks and instruments , in particular those under the aegis of the United Nations , since those crimes can be conducive to the perpetration of other criminal activities ,
Noting with appreciation the work of the regional preparatory meetings for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , A / CONF . 203 / RPM . 1 / 1 , A / CONF . 203 / RPM . 2 / 1 , A / CONF . 203 / RPM . 3 / 1 and Corr . 1 and A / CONF . 203 / RPM . 4 / 1 .
Declare as follows :
1 . We proclaim our political will and commitment to achieve the aspirations and objectives as set out in the present Declaration .
2 . We reaffirm our continued support for and commitment to the United Nations and to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , especially the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the institutes of the Programme network , and resolve to strengthen the Programme further through sustained funding , as appropriate .
3 . In a spirit of common and shared responsibility , we reaffirm our readiness to seek to improve international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism , at the multilateral , regional and bilateral levels , in areas including , among others , extradition and mutual legal assistance . We seek to ensure our national capacity and , where appropriate , the coherence of our international capacity , through the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to engage in international cooperation , in particular in the prevention , investigation , prosecution and adjudication of transnational organized crime and terrorism and in the discovery of any existing links among them .
4 . We welcome the entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two of its Protocols . Resolution 55 / 25 , annexes I - III . We call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to ratify or accede to and implement the provisions of that Convention and its Protocols , as well as the provisions of the United Nations Convention against CorruptionResolution 58 / 4 , annex . and the international instruments against terrorism . In implementing the provisions of those instruments , we commit ourselves to full compliance with our obligations under international law , in particular international human rights , refugee and humanitarian law . We support every effort to facilitate the implementation of those instruments .
5 . We call upon donor States and financial institutions to continue to make adequate voluntary contributions on a regular basis for the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition , in order to help build their capacity to prevent and tackle crime in all its forms and apply the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and , in particular , to facilitate their becoming parties to and implementing the international instruments against terrorism and the relevant international instruments against crime , such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto , the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the international drug control conventions .
6 . We support a more integrated approach within the United Nations in relation to the provision of assistance for building capacity in crime prevention and criminal justice , and in cooperation in criminal matters of a transnational character , as a contribution to the establishment and strengthening of the rule of law .
7 . We seek to improve our responses to crime and terrorism nationally and internationally , inter alia , by collecting and sharing information on crime and terrorism and on effective countermeasures , in accordance with national legislation . We welcome the important work done by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the area of trends in crime and justice .
8 . We are convinced that upholding the rule of law and good governance and proper management of public affairs and public property at the local , national and international levels are prerequisites for creating and sustaining an environment for successfully preventing and combating crime . We are committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions , including the humane treatment of all those in pretrial and correctional facilities , in accordance with applicable international standards .
9 . We recognize the role of individuals and groups outside the public sector , such as civil society , non - governmental organizations and community - based organizations , in contributing to the prevention of and the fight against crime and terrorism . We encourage the adoption of measures to strengthen this role within the rule of law .
10 . We recognize that comprehensive and effective crime prevention strategies can significantly reduce crime and victimization . We urge that such strategies address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization and that they be further developed and implemented at the local , national and international levels , taking into account , inter alia , the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime . Economic and Social Council resolution 2002 / 13 , annex .
11 . We note that countries emerging from conflict are particularly vulnerable to crime , in particular organized crime and corruption , and therefore recommend that Member States , regional organizations and international entities such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , in coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat and other relevant entities , provide more effective responses to these problems , in order to re - establish , strengthen or sustain the rule of law and deliver justice in post - conflict situations .
12 . With regard to the increased involvement of organized criminal groups in the theft of and trafficking in cultural property and illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , we recognize the importance of combating these forms of crime and , bearing in mind the relevant international legal instruments , such as the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import , Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property , United Nations , Treaty Series , vol . 823 , No . 11806 . the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and FloraIbid . , vol . 993 , No . 14537 . and the Convention on Biological Diversity , Ibid . , vol . 1760 , No . 30619 . we call upon Member States to take effective measures to strengthen international cooperation .
13 . We note with concern the rise in kidnapping and trafficking in persons , which constitute serious , profitable and inhumane forms of organized crime , often committed with the objective of funding criminal organizations and , in some cases , terrorist activities , and hence recommend that measures be devised to combat these crimes and that attention be given to the creation of practical mechanisms for countering them . We recognize the need to implement measures intended to provide adequate assistance and protection to victims of kidnapping and trafficking in persons and their families .
14 . Mindful of General Assembly resolution 59 / 156 of 20 December 2004 on preventing , combating and punishing trafficking in human organs , we note the serious concerns raised about the illicit removal of and trafficking in human organs and will examine with interest the report of the Secretary - General requested in that resolution .
15 . We reaffirm the fundamental importance of the implementation of existing instruments and the further development of national measures and international cooperation in relation to criminal matters , such as consideration of strengthening and augmenting measures , in particular against cybercrime , money - laundering and trafficking in cultural property , as well as extradition , mutual legal assistance and the confiscation , recovery and return of proceeds of crime .
16 . We note that , in the current period of globalization , information technology and the rapid development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those technologies for criminal purposes . We therefore welcome efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent , investigate and prosecute high - technology and computer - related crime , including through the development of partnerships with the private sector . We recognize the important contribution of the United Nations to regional and other international forums in the fight against cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , taking into account that experience , to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations , in partnership with other similarly focused organizations .
17 . We recognize the importance of giving special attention to the need to protect witnesses and victims of crime and terrorism , and we commit ourselves to strengthening , where needed , the legal and financial framework for providing support to such victims , taking into account , inter alia , the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power . Resolution 40 / 34 , annex .
18 . We call upon Member States to take steps , in accordance with their domestic laws , to promote access to justice , to consider the provision of legal aid to those who need it and to enable the effective assertion of their rights in the criminal justice system .
19 . We note with concern the problem of trafficking in illicit drugs and the serious socio - economic consequences it entails , and therefore call for the strengthening of international cooperation in combating that form of organized crime .
20 . We will strengthen international cooperation in order to create an environment that is conducive to the fight against crime , including by promoting growth and sustainable development and eradicating poverty and unemployment by means of effective and balanced development strategies and crime prevention policies .
21 . We call upon States that have not yet done so to become parties to and implement the universal instruments against terrorism . In order to enhance the capacity of States to become parties to and implement those instruments and to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism , we express our support for the continuing efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , within its mandate and in coordination with the Counter - Terrorism Committee and the Counter - Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate of the Security Council , to assist States in their efforts to ratify and implement those instruments , through the provision of technical assistance upon request . This might include assistance to criminal justice systems to facilitate the effective implementation of those instruments .
22 . We express the hope that the ongoing negotiation of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism will be concluded as soon as possible . In this context , we recognize that arriving at a possible definition of terrorism is one of the key issues to be resolved . We call upon Member States to consider signing and ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism . Resolution 59 / 290 , annex .
23 . We are convinced that the expeditious entry into force and subsequent implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption are central to the efforts made at the international level to fight corruption and therefore accord high priority to supporting efforts to that end and call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to sign , ratify or accede to the Convention .
24 . We are also convinced that the proper management of public affairs and public property and the rule of law are essential to the prevention and control of corruption , including , inter alia , through effective measures for its investigation and prosecution . Furthermore , we recognize that , in order to curb corruption , it is necessary to promote a culture of integrity and accountability in both the public and the private sector .
25 . We are convinced that asset recovery is one of the essential components of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and , for that reason , we emphasize the need to adopt measures to facilitate asset recovery that are consistent with the principles of that Convention .
26 . We are conscious of the challenge of investigating and prosecuting complex cases involving economic and financial crimes , including money - laundering . We call upon Member States to strengthen policies , measures and institutions for national action and international cooperation in the prevention , investigation and prosecution of economic and financial crimes , including money - laundering , and such crimes conducted by means of , or facilitated by , information technologies , in particular in connection with the financing of terrorism and trafficking in illicit drugs .
27 . We are conscious of the crucial importance of tackling document and identity fraud in order to curb organized crime and terrorism . We seek to improve international cooperation , including through technical assistance , to combat document and identity fraud , in particular the fraudulent use of travel documents , through improved security measures , and encourage the adoption of appropriate national legislation .
28 . We recommend that voluntary contributions and appropriate technical assistance be made available to developing countries to strengthen their capacity in order to support their efforts to fight effectively economic and financial crimes .
29 . As appropriate , we endeavour to use and apply the United Nations standards and norms in our national programmes for crime prevention and criminal justice reform and to undertake , as needed , efforts to ensure their wider dissemination . We endeavour to facilitate appropriate training for law enforcement officials , including prison officials , prosecutors , the judiciary and other relevant professional groups , taking into account those norms and standards and best practices at the international level .
30 . We recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners .
31 . We note with concern that the physical and social conditions associated with imprisonment may facilitate the spread of HIV / AIDS in pretrial and correctional facilities and thus in society , thereby presenting a critical prison management problem ; we call upon States to develop and adopt measures and guidelines , where appropriate and in accordance with national legislation , to ensure that the particular problems of HIV / AIDS are adequately addressed in such facilities .
32 . To promote the interests of victims and the rehabilitation of offenders , we recognize the importance of further developing restorative justice policies , procedures and programmes that include alternatives to prosecution , thereby avoiding possible adverse effects of imprisonment , helping to decrease the caseload of criminal courts and promoting the incorporation of restorative justice approaches into criminal justice systems , as appropriate .
33 . We affirm our determination to pay particular attention to juvenile justice . We will consider ways to ensure the provision of services to children who are victims of crime and children in conflict with the law , in particular those deprived of their liberty , and to ensure that those services take into account their gender , social circumstances and developmental needs and the relevant United Nations standards and norms , as appropriate .
34 . We stress the need to consider measures to prevent the expansion of urban crime , including by improving international cooperation and capacity - building for law enforcement and the judiciary in that area and by promoting the involvement of local authorities and civil society .
35 . We express our profound gratitude to the people and the Government of Thailand for their warm and generous hospitality towards the participants and for the excellent facilities provided for the Eleventh Congress .

Stresses that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with poverty eradication , sustained economic growth and sustainable development and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals , including the Millennium Development Goals , and in this regard urges countries to direct those resources freed through debt relief , in particular through debt cancellation and reduction , towards these objectives ;
9 . Reiterates that debt sustainability depends on a confluence of many factors at the international and national levels , emphasizes that country - specific circumstances and the impact of external shocks should be taken into account in debt sustainability analyses , underscores the fact that no single indicator should be used to make definitive judgements about debt sustainability , and in this regard , while acknowledging the need to use transparent and comparable indicators , invites the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , in their assessment of debt sustainability , to take into account fundamental changes caused by , inter alia , natural disasters , conflicts , changes in global growth prospects or in the terms of trade , especially for commodity - dependent developing countries , and to continue to provide information on this issue using existing cooperation forums , including those involving Member States ;

12 . Notes with concern that , in spite of the progress achieved , some countries that have reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative have not been able to achieve lasting debt sustainability , stresses the importance of promoting responsible borrowing and lending and the need to help those countries to manage their borrowing and to avoid a build - up of unsustainable debt , including through the use of grants , and in this regard welcomes the ongoing work by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to develop a forward - looking debt sustainability framework for heavily indebted poor countries and low - income countries ;
13 . Welcomes the continued flexibility with regard to the application of eligibility criteria for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , in particular for low - income developing countries emerging from conflicts and / or affected by natural disasters , and on the computational procedures and assumptions underlying debt sustainability analysis , and in this regard takes note of the work on identifying low - income countries with unsustainable debt as of the end of 2004 , with a view to finalization , by early 2006 , of the list of countries potentially eligible for assistance under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative ;

15 . Calls upon creditor countries , in this regard , to continue to ensure that a tailored response to debt restructuring is granted only in a case of imminent default and is not considered by debtor countries as an alternative to more expensive sources of finance , and takes into account country - specific circumstances , financial vulnerabilities and the objective of enhancing long - lasting debt sustainability , while emphasizing that creditors and debtors must share responsibility for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations in a timely and efficient manner ;

17 . Stresses the need to find a solution for the debt problems of low - and middle - income developing countries with unsustainable debt burdens that are not eligible for assistance under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , and in this regard invites creditors and debtors to continue to use , where appropriate and on a case - by - case basis , mechanisms such as debt swaps for alleviating their debt burden , and also stresses that this should be achieved in a fashion that does not detract from official development assistance resources , while maintaining the financial integrity of the multilateral financial institutions ;

7 . We believe that today , more than ever before , we live in a global and interdependent world . No State can stand wholly alone . We acknowledge that collective security depends on effective cooperation , in accordance with international law , against transnational threats .
8 . We recognize that current developments and circumstances require that we urgently build consensus on major threats and challenges .

15 . We pledge to enhance the relevance , effectiveness , efficiency , accountability and credibility of the United Nations system . This is our shared responsibility and interest .
16 . We therefore resolve to create a more peaceful , prosperous and democratic world and to undertake concrete measures to continue finding ways to implement the outcome of the Millennium Summit and the other major United Nations conferences and summits so as to provide multilateral solutions to problems in the four following areas :
• Development
• Peace and collective security
• Human rights and the rule of law
• Strengthening of the United Nations
II . Development
17 . We strongly reiterate our determination to ensure the timely and full realization of the development goals and objectives agreed at the major United Nations conferences and summits , including those agreed at the Millennium Summit that are described as the Millennium Development Goals , which have helped to galvanize efforts towards poverty eradication .
18 . We emphasize the vital role played by the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic , social and related fields in shaping a broad development vision and in identifying commonly agreed objectives , which have contributed to improving human life in different parts of the world .
19 . We reaffirm our commitment to eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth , sustainable development and global prosperity for all . We are encouraged by reductions in poverty in some countries in the recent past and are determined to reinforce and extend this trend to benefit people worldwide . We remain concerned , however , about the slow and uneven progress towards poverty eradication and the realization of other development goals in some regions . We commit ourselves to promoting the development of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization . We underline the need for urgent action on all sides , including more ambitious national development strategies and efforts backed by increased international support .
Global partnership for development
20 . We reaffirm our commitment to the global partnership for development set out in the Millennium Declaration , See resolution 55 / 2 . the Monterrey ConsensusMonterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development ( Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development , Monterrey , Mexico , 18 - 22 March 2002 ( United Nations publication , Sales No . E . 02 . II . A . 7 ) , chap . I , resolution 1 , annex ) . and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation . Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ( Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development , Johannesburg , South Africa , 26 August - 4 September 2002 ( United Nations publication , Sales No . E . 03 . II . A . 1 and corrigendum ) , chap . I , resolution 2 , annex ) .
21 . We further reaffirm our commitment to sound policies , good governance at all levels and the rule of law , and to mobilize domestic resources , attract international flows , promote international trade as an engine for development and increase international financial and technical cooperation for development , sustainable debt financing and external debt relief and to enhance the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems .
22 . We reaffirm that each country must take primary responsibility for its own development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development . We also recognize that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes , measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries , while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership , strategies and sovereignty . To this end , we resolve :
( a ) To adopt , by 2006 , and implement comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives , including the Millennium Development Goals ;
( b ) To manage public finances effectively to achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability and long - term growth and to make effective and transparent use of public funds and ensure that development assistance is used to build national capacities ;
( c ) To support efforts by developing countries to adopt and implement national development policies and strategies through increased development assistance , the promotion of international trade as an engine for development , the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms , increased investment flows and wider and deeper debt relief , and to support developing countries by providing a substantial increase in aid of sufficient quality and arriving in a timely manner to assist them in achieving the internationally agreed development goals , including the Millennium Development Goals ;
( d ) That the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule - based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy , that is , the scope for domestic policies , especially in the areas of trade , investment and industrial development , is now often framed by international disciplines , commitments and global market considerations . It is for each Government to evaluate the trade - off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space . It is particularly important for developing countries , bearing in mind development goals and objectives , that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments ;
( e ) To enhance the contribution of non - governmental organizations , civil society , the private sector and other stakeholders in national development efforts , as well as in the promotion of the global partnership for development ;
( f ) To ensure that the United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies support the efforts of developing countries through the common country assessment and United Nations Development Assistance Framework process , enhancing their support for capacity - building ;
( g ) To protect our natural resource base in support of development .
Financing for development
23 . We reaffirm the Monterrey ConsensusMonterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development ( Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development , Monterrey , Mexico , 18 - 22 March 2002 ( United Nations publication , Sales No . E . 02 . II . A . 7 ) , chap . I , resolution 1 , annex ) . and recognize that mobilizing financial resources for development and the effective use of those resources in developing countries and countries with economies in transition are central to a global partnership for development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals , including the Millennium Development Goals . In this regard :
( a ) We are encouraged by recent commitments to substantial increases in official development assistance and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimate that official development assistance to all developing countries will now increase by around 50 billion United States dollars a year by 2010 , while recognizing that a substantial increase in such assistance is required to achieve the internationally agreed goals , including the Millennium Development Goals , within their respective time frames ;
( b ) We welcome the increased resources that will become available as a result of the establishment of timetables by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0 . 7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by 2015 and to reach at least 0 . 5 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by 2010 as well as , pursuant to the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001 - 2010 , A / CONF . 191 / 13 , chap . II . 0 . 15 per cent to 0 . 20 per cent for the least developed countries no later than 2010 , and urge those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their commitments ;
( c ) We further welcome recent efforts and initiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact , including the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness , and resolve to take concrete , effective and timely action in implementing all agreed commitments on aid effectiveness , with clear monitoring and deadlines , including through further aligning assistance with countries ' strategies , building institutional capacities , reducing transaction costs and eliminating bureaucratic procedures , making progress on untying aid , enhancing the absorptive capacity and financial management of recipient countries and strengthening the focus on development results ;
( d ) We recognize the value of developing innovative sources of financing , provided those sources do not unduly burden developing countries . In that regard , we take note with interest of the international efforts , contributions and discussions , such as the Action against Hunger and Poverty , aimed at identifying innovative and additional sources of financing for development on a public , private , domestic or external basis to increase and supplement traditional sources of financing . Some countries will implement the International Finance Facility . Some countries have launched the International Finance Facility for immunization . Some countries will implement in the near future , utilizing their national authorities , a contribution on airline tickets to enable the financing of development projects , in particular in the health sector , directly or through financing of the International Finance Facility . Other countries are considering whether and to what extent they will participate in these initiatives ;
( e ) We acknowledge the vital role the private sector can play in generating new investments , employment and financing for development ;
( f ) We resolve to address the development needs of low - income developing countries by working in competent multilateral and international forums , to help them meet , inter alia , their financial , technical and technological requirements ;
( g ) We resolve to continue to support the development efforts of middle - income developing countries by working , in competent multilateral and international forums and also through bilateral arrangements , on measures to help them meet , inter alia , their financial , technical and technological requirements ;
( h ) We resolve to operationalize the World Solidarity Fund established by the General Assembly and invite those countries in a position to do so to make voluntary contributions to the Fund ;
( i ) We recognize the need for access to financial services , in particular for the poor , including through microfinance and microcredit .
Domestic resource mobilization
24 . In our common pursuit of growth , poverty eradication and sustainable development , a critical challenge is to ensure the necessary internal conditions for mobilizing domestic savings , both public and private , sustaining adequate levels of productive investment , increasing human capacity , reducing capital flight , curbing the illicit transfer of funds and enhancing international cooperation for creating an enabling domestic environment . We undertake to support the efforts of developing countries to create a domestic enabling environment for mobilizing domestic resources . To this end , we therefore resolve :
( a ) To pursue good governance and sound macroeconomic policies at all levels and support developing countries in their efforts to put in place the policies and investments to drive sustained economic growth , promote small and medium - sized enterprises , promote employment generation and stimulate the private sector ;
( b ) To reaffirm that good governance is essential for sustainable development ; that sound economic policies , solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth , poverty eradication and employment creation ; and that freedom , peace and security , domestic stability , respect for human rights , including the right to development , the rule of law , gender equality and market - oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing ;
( c ) To make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and we welcome all actions taken in this regard at the national and international levels , including the adoption of policies that emphasize accountability , transparent public sector management and corporate responsibility and accountability , including efforts to return assets transferred through corruption , consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption . Resolution 58 / 4 , annex . We urge all States that have not done so to consider signing , ratifying and implementing the Convention ;
( d ) To channel private capabilities and resources into stimulating the private sector in developing countries through actions in the public , public / private and private spheres to create an enabling environment for partnership and innovation that contributes to accelerated economic development and hunger and poverty eradication ;
( e ) To support efforts to reduce capital flight and measures to curb the illicit transfer of funds .
Investment
25 . We resolve to encourage greater direct investment , including foreign investment , in developing countries and countries with economies in transition to support their development activities and to enhance the benefits they can derive from such investments . In this regard :
( a ) We continue to support efforts by developing countries and countries with economies in transition to create a domestic environment conducive to attracting investments through , inter alia , achieving a transparent , stable and predictable investment climate with proper contract enforcement and respect for property rights and the rule of law and pursuing appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks that encourage business formation ;
( b ) We will put into place policies to ensure adequate investment in a sustainable manner in health , clean water and sanitation , housing and education and in the provision of public goods and social safety nets to protect vulnerable and disadvantaged sectors of society ;
( c ) We invite national Governments seeking to develop infrastructure projects and generate foreign direct investment to pursue strategies with the involvement of both the public and private sectors and , where appropriate , international donors ;
( d ) We call upon international financial and banking institutions to consider enhancing the transparency of risk rating mechanisms . Sovereign risk assessments , made by the private sector should maximize the use of strict , objective and transparent parameters , which can be facilitated by high - quality data and analysis ;
( e ) We underscore the need to sustain sufficient and stable private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition . It is important to promote measures in source and destination countries to improve transparency and the information about financial flows to developing countries , particularly countries in Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States and landlocked developing countries . Measures that mitigate the impact of excessive volatility of short - term capital flows are important and must be considered .
Debt
26 . We emphasize the high importance of a timely , effective , comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , since debt financing and relief can be an important source of capital for development . To this end :
( a ) We welcome the recent proposals of the Group of Eight to cancel 100 per cent of the outstanding debt of eligible heavily indebted poor countries owed to the International Monetary Fund , the International Development Association and African Development Fund and to provide additional resources to ensure that the financing capacity of the international financial institutions is not reduced ;
( b ) We emphasize that debt sustainability is essential for underpinning growth and underline the importance of debt sustainability to the efforts to achieve national development goals , including the Millennium Development Goals , recognizing the key role that debt relief can play in liberating resources that can be directed towards activities consistent with poverty eradication , sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;
( c ) We further stress the need to consider additional measures and initiatives aimed at ensuring long - term debt sustainability through increased grant - based financing , cancellation of 100 per cent of the official multilateral and bilateral debt of heavily indebted poor countries and , where appropriate , and on a case - by - case basis , to consider significant debt relief or restructuring for low - and middle - income developing countries with an unsustainable debt burden that are not part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , as well as the exploration of mechanisms to comprehensively address the debt problems of those countries . Such mechanisms may include debt for sustainable development swaps or multicreditor debt swap arrangements , as appropriate . These initiatives could include further efforts by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to develop the debt sustainability framework for low - income countries . This should be achieved in a fashion that does not detract from official development assistance resources , while maintaining the financial integrity of the multilateral financial institutions .
Trade
27 . A universal , rule - based , open , non - discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system , as well as meaningful trade liberalization , can substantially stimulate development worldwide , benefiting countries at all stages of development . In that regard , we reaffirm our commitment to trade liberalization and to ensure that trade plays its full part in promoting economic growth , employment and development for all .
28 . We are committed to efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least - developed countries , participate fully in the world trading system in order to meet their economic development needs , and reaffirm our commitment to enhanced and predictable market access for the exports of developing countries .
29 . We will work towards the objective , in accordance with the Brussels Programme of Action , A / CONF . 191 / 13 , chap . II . of duty - free and quota - free market access for all least developed countries ' products to the markets of developed countries , as well as to the markets of developing countries in a position to do so , and support their efforts to overcome their supply - side constraints .
30 . We are committed to supporting and promoting increased aid to build productive and trade capacities of developing countries and to taking further steps in that regard , while welcoming the substantial support already provided .
31 . We will work to accelerate and facilitate the accession of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to the World Trade Organization consistent with its criteria , recognizing the importance of universal integration in the rules - based global trading system .
32 . We will work expeditiously towards implementing the development dimensions of the Doha work programme . See A / C . 2 / 56 / 7 , annex .
Commodities
33 . We emphasize the need to address the impact of weak and volatile commodity prices and support the efforts of commodity - dependent countries to restructure , diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their commodity sectors .
Quick - impact initiatives
34 . Given the need to accelerate progress immediately in countries where current trends make the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals unlikely , we resolve to urgently identify and implement country - led initiatives with adequate international support , consistent with long - term national development strategies , that promise immediate and durable improvements in the lives of people and renewed hope for the achievement of the development goals . In this regard , we will take such actions as the distribution of malaria bed nets , including free distribution , where appropriate , and effective anti - malarial treatments , the expansion of local school meal programmes , using home - grown foods where possible , and the elimination of user fees for primary education and , where appropriate , health - care services .
Systemic issues and global economic decision - making
35 . We reaffirm the commitment to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision - making and norm - setting , and to that end stress the importance of continuing efforts to reform the international financial architecture , noting that enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the Bretton Woods institutions remains a continuous concern .
36 . We reaffirm our commitment to governance , equity and transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems . We are also committed to open , equitable , rule - based , predictable and non - discriminatory multilateral trading and financial systems .
37 . We also underscore our commitment to sound domestic financial sectors , which make a vital contribution to national development efforts , as an important component of an international financial architecture that is supportive of development .
38 . We further reaffirm the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence , coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community , and we resolve to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial , trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth , poverty eradication and sustainable development .
39 . Good governance at the international level is fundamental for achieving sustainable development . In order to ensure a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , it is important to promote global economic governance through addressing the international finance , trade , technology and investment patterns that have an impact on the development prospects of developing countries . To this effect , the international community should take all necessary and appropriate measures , including ensuring support for structural and macroeconomic reform , a comprehensive solution to the external debt problem and increasing the market access of developing countries .
South - South cooperation
40 . We recognize the achievements and great potential of South - South cooperation and encourage the promotion of such cooperation , which complements North - South cooperation as an effective contribution to development and as a means to share best practices and provide enhanced technical cooperation . In this context , we note the recent decision of the leaders of the South , adopted at the Second South Summit and contained in the Doha DeclarationA / 60 / 111 , annex I . and the Doha Plan of Action , Ibid . , annex II . to intensify their efforts at South - South cooperation , including through the establishment of the New Asian - African Strategic Partnership and other regional cooperation mechanisms , and encourage the international community , including the international financial institutions , to support the efforts of developing countries , inter alia , through triangular cooperation . We also take note with appreciation of the launching of the third round of negotiations on the Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries as an important instrument to stimulate South - South cooperation .
41 . We welcome the work of the United Nations High - Level Committee on South - South Cooperation and invite countries to consider supporting the Special Unit for South - South Cooperation within the United Nations Development Programme in order to respond effectively to the development needs of developing countries .
42 . We recognize the considerable contribution of arrangements such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Fund initiated by a group of developing countries , as well as the potential contribution of the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance , to development activities in developing countries .
Education
43 . We emphasize the critical role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other development goals as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration , See resolution 55 / 2 . in particular basic education and training for eradicating illiteracy , and strive for expanded secondary and higher education as well as vocational education and technical training , especially for girls and women , the creation of human resources and infrastructure capabilities and the empowerment of those living in poverty . In this context , we reaffirm the Dakar Framework for Action adopted at the World Education Forum in 2000See United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , Final Report of the World Education Forum , Dakar , Senegal , 26 - 28 April 2000 ( Paris , 2000 ) . and recognize the importance of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for the eradication of poverty , especially extreme poverty , in supporting the Education for All programmes as a tool to achieve the millennium development goal of universal primary education by 2015 .
44 . We reaffirm our commitment to support developing country efforts to ensure that all children have access to and complete free and compulsory primary education of good quality , to eliminate gender inequality and imbalance and to renew efforts to improve girls ' education . We also commit ourselves to continuing to support the efforts of developing countries in the implementation of the Education for All initiative , including with enhanced resources of all types through the Education for All fast - track initiative in support of country - led national education plans .
45 . We commit ourselves to promoting education for peace and human development .
Rural and agricultural development
46 .

Deeply convinced of the urgent need for enhanced coordination efforts at the global level to reduce the impact of disasters ,
Recognizing , in that regard , that unnecessary loss of life and property could be avoided if better information were available regarding the risk and onset of disasters , through improved risk assessment , early warning and monitoring of disasters ,
Convinced that the use of existing space technology , such as Earth observation and meteorological satellites , communications satellites and satellite navigation and positioning systems , and their applications , can play a vital role in supporting disaster management by providing accurate and timely information for decision - making and re - establishing communication in case of disasters ,
Desirous of enhancing international coordination at the global level in disaster management and emergency response through greater access to and use of space - based services for all countries and facilitating capacity - building and institutional strengthening for disaster management , in particular in developing countries ,

Concerned that the presidential election of 19 March 2006 was severely flawed and fell significantly short of the commitments of Belarus to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to hold a free and fair election , and that the situation of human rights in Belarus in 2005 was steadily deteriorating , as documented in the final report of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and in the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus , E / CN . 4 / 2006 / 36 .
Noting that the Belarusian authorities have decided to hold local elections on 14 January 2007 , and expressing its hope that those will be free and fair , in full respect of international electoral standards ,

( b ) That in spite of detailed recommendations by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and dialogue between the Government and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe following previous elections , Belarus again failed to meet its commitments to hold free and fair elections , including through the arbitrary use of State power against opposition candidates , routine harassment , the detention and arrest of political and civil society activists , the obstruction of the access of opposition candidates to State media , the negative portrayal in the State media of opposition candidates and activists , including human rights defenders , and the serious shortcomings of the vote count , which lacked minimum transparency ;

2 . Urges the Government of Belarus :
( a ) To bring the electoral process and legislative framework into line with international standards , especially those of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , demonstrate such commitment through the upcoming local elections in January 2007 and rectify the shortcomings of the electoral process , identified by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in its report of 7 June 2006 , including , inter alia , election laws and practices that restrict campaigning opportunities for de facto opposition candidates , arbitrary application of electoral laws , including on registration of candidates , obstruction of the right of access to the media , biased presentation of the issues by the State media and falsification of vote counts ;

Reaffirming that indigenous peoples , in the exercise of their rights , should be free from discrimination of any kind ,
Concerned that indigenous peoples have suffered from historic injustices as a result of , inter alia , their colonization and dispossession of their lands , territories and resources , thus preventing them from exercising , in particular , their right to development in accordance with their own needs and interests ,
